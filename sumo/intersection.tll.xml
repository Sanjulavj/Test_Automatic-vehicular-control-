    <!--
        Traffic Light Program for junction "C"
        ========================================
        4 phases — standard NEMA-style dual-ring simplified:

        Phase 0 (42s): N-S through GREEN,  E-W RED
        Phase 1 ( 3s): N-S YELLOW,         E-W RED
        Phase 2 (42s): E-W through GREEN,  N-S RED
        Phase 3 ( 3s): E-W YELLOW,         N-S RED

        Signal string index order (set by netconvert for a 4-arm, 2-lane junction):
        Each incoming edge contributes connections in the order netconvert assigns them.
        We use "G" = green, "y" = yellow, "r" = red, "g" = green (lower priority / permissive).

        Because exact link indices depend on netconvert output, this TLL is written
        as a template with 16 signals (4 arms × 2 lanes × 2 movements each, roughly).
        After running netconvert, open the generated .net.xml to verify link count
        and adjust the state strings if needed.

        Tip: run sumo with the net file and gui, then press the TL button
             to inspect the live signal states visually.
